## Git Basics: Add and Commit

This section provides an overview of essential Git commands you'll use frequently during this bootcamp.

### Workflow Overview
1. **Create a Local Repository**:
   - Use `git init` to initialize an empty repository.
   - Verify the repository status with `git status`.

2. **Add Files to the Staging Area**:
   - Add individual files: `git add <filename>`.
   - Add multiple files: `git add <file1> <file2>`.
   - Add all changes: `git add .`.

3. **Commit Changes to the Repository**:
   - Commit staged changes with a message: `git commit -m "Your commit message"`.
   - Ensure commit messages are clear and concise to help track changes.

### Editing Files
- Modify files and check their status with `git status`.
- Stage modified files using `git add <filename>`.
- Commit changes with a descriptive message.

### Tools and Recommendations
- Use **Visual Studio Code** for editing and tracking changes.
  - It integrates well with Git and GitHub, especially for Windows users.
  - Open your terminal within VS Code for seamless workflow.

### Example Workflow
1. Create a new file (`file1.txt`) and add content.
2. Stage the file: `git add file1.txt`.
3. Commit the file: `git commit -m "Added file1.txt"`.
4. Push changes to GitHub 

### Git Log: Viewing Commit History

The `git log` command allows you to view the history of all commits made to a repository. It displays useful information such as:
- The commit hash
- The author (name and email)
- The date of the commit
- The commit message

#### Example Usage
1. Run the following command to view the commit history:
   ```bash
   git log
   ```
   This will display a list of commits, including metadata and messages.

2. Navigate through the log:
   - Press `Enter` to scroll through the log.
   - Type `q` to exit the log view.

#### Why Use Git Log?
- Understand the history of changes in your repository.
- Track who made specific changes and when.
- Review commit messages for context on past updates.

### Pushing Code to a Remote Branch

This section explains how to push your local code to a remote branch on GitHub.

#### Workflow Overview
1. **Check for Remote Branches**:
   - Use `git remote -v` to view connected remote branches and their URLs.
   - If no remote branch is connected, you wonâ€™t see any output.

2. **Add a Remote Branch**:
   - Connect your local repository to a remote branch:
     ```bash
     git remote add origin <repository-URL>
     ```
   - By convention, the remote branch is named `origin`.

3. **Push Local Code to the Remote Branch**:
   - Push your commits to the remote branch:
     ```bash
     git push -u origin main
     ```
   - Replace `main` with `master` if your local branch is named `master`.

#### Notes on Branch Naming
- GitHub has transitioned from using `master` to `main` as the default branch name.
- You can rename your branch locally using:
  ```bash
  git branch -M main
  ```

#### Additional Commands
- **Rename a Remote Branch**:
  ```bash
  git remote rename <old-name> <new-name>
  ```
- **Remove a Remote Branch**:
  ```bash
  git remote remove <name>
  ```

#### Using Personal Access Tokens
- If you encounter permission errors, include your personal access token in the repository URL when adding the remote branch.

#### Using SSH for Authentication
- To securely connect your local repository to GitHub, use SSH instead of Personal Access Tokens.
- First, ensure your SSH key is added to your GitHub account. You can generate an SSH key using:
  ```bash
  ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
  ```
- Add the SSH key to your GitHub account by copying the public key (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`) and pasting it into your GitHub SSH settings.

#### Adding a Remote Branch with SSH
- Use the following command to add a remote branch with SSH:
  ```bash
  git remote add origin git@github.com:<username>/<repository-name>.git
  ```
- Replace `<username>` and `<repository-name>` with your GitHub username and repository name.

#### Push Local Code to the Remote Branch
- Push your commits to the remote branch using SSH:
  ```bash
  git push -u origin main
  ```
- Replace `main` with `master` if your local branch is named `master`.

### Fetching and Pulling Changes from a Remote Branch

This section explains how to bring changes from a remote repository (e.g., GitHub) to your local machine using `git fetch` and `git pull`.

#### Workflow Overview
1. **Fetch Changes**:
   - Use `git fetch` to download changes from the remote repository without modifying your working directory files:
     ```bash
     git fetch origin
     ```
   - This updates your local repository with the latest commits from the remote branch but does not merge them into your working directory.

2. **Check Remote Changes**:
   - Use `git log` to view the fetched commits:
     ```bash
     git log origin/main
     ```
   - You can also use `git checkout origin/main` to inspect the remote branch without affecting your local branch.

3. **Pull Changes**:
   - Use `git pull` to fetch and merge changes from the remote branch into your local branch:
     ```bash
     git pull origin main
     ```
   - This updates your working directory files to match the remote branch.

#### Key Differences Between `git fetch` and `git pull`
- **`git fetch`**:
  - Downloads changes from the remote repository.
  - Does not modify your working directory files.
  - Useful for inspecting changes before merging them.

- **`git pull`**:
  - Combines `git fetch` and `git merge` into a single command.
  - Updates your working directory files to match the remote branch.
  - Ideal for solo developers working on a single branch.

#### Best Practices
- Use `git fetch` to inspect changes before merging, especially when working in teams or managing conflicts.
- Use `git pull` for a quick update when you are confident there are no conflicts.
- Always pull changes before pushing to ensure your local branch is in sync with the remote branch.

### Best Practices for Using Git

1. **Commit Frequently**:
   - Make small, meaningful commits to track changes effectively.
   - Use clear and concise commit messages.

2. **Pull Before Pushing**:
   - Always pull changes from the remote branch before pushing to ensure your local branch is up-to-date.

3. **Use Branches**:
   - Create separate branches for new features or bug fixes.
   - Merge branches carefully to avoid conflicts.

4. **Inspect Changes Before Merging**:
   - Use `git fetch` to review changes before merging them into your working directory.

5. **Keep Your Repository Clean**:
   - Avoid committing unnecessary files (e.g., temporary files or IDE settings).
   - Use `.gitignore` to exclude files that shouldn't be tracked.

6. **Learn Conflict Resolution**:
   - Understand how to resolve merge conflicts effectively.
   - Use tools like Visual Studio Code's Git integration for easier conflict management.

7. **Secure Your Repository**:
   - Use SSH for authentication instead of Personal Access Tokens.
   - Regularly review your remote connections with `git remote -v`.
